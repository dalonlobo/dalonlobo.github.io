# your projects
projects:
- name: Acoustic Speech Recognition
  # logo: /images/sections/projects/kubernetes.png
  role: Research and Developer
  # timeline: "March 2018 - Present"
  # repo: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  url: "https://www.videoken.com"  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: Designed and implemented an end-to-end Acoustic Speech Recognition(ASR) pipeline, using the Baiduâ€™s DeepSpeech2 ASR architecture trained on 1000 hrs of custom transcribed audio and reduced the Word Error Rate to 8%, which helped Videoken's AI based video platform to increase video engagement by 30% in one week. This includes RESTful backend with Flask hosted on nginx(AWS), Cosmosdb, and model inference on GPU machine. Built a preprocessing pipeline, which downloaded the video, split the converted audio before speech to text, post-process the text into SRT (subtitle) file which syncs with the original video.
