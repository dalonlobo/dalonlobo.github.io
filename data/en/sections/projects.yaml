  summary: Designed and implemented an end-to-end Acoustic Speech Recognition(ASR) pipeline, using the Baiduâ€™s DeepSpeech2 ASR architecture trained on 1000 hrs of custom transcribed audio and reduced the Word Error Rate to 8%, which helped Videoken's AI based video platform to increase video engagement by 30% in one week. This includes RESTful backend with Flask hosted on nginx(AWS), Cosmosdb, and model inference on GPU machine. Built a preprocessing pipeline, which downloaded the video, split the converted audio before speech to text, post-process the text into SRT (subtitle) file which syncs with the original video.
